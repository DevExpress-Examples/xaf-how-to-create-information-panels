# XAF - How to: Create information panels

In certain scenarios, you may need to create additional functional areas in a UI to display data. You can do this using additional controls in XAF templates and by implementing the code that supplies data to the controls.

## Implementation Details

To accomplish this task, follow the steps below: 

1. Create a custom template as described in the following topic: [Templates](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112609/ui-construction/templates).
2. Add to this custom template a UI element that should display the additional information (e.g., [div](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.ASP)).
3. To pass data to this element, use a dedicated [ViewController](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.ViewController) that accesses the template and passes required information to this template.
