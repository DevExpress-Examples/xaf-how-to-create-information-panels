# How to: Create Information Panels

In certain scenarios you may be required to create additional functional regions in a UI to display specific data. This task can be solved by including additional controls into XAF templates and implementing the code that will supply data to the controls.

## Implementation Details

To accomplish this task create a custom template as described at [Templates](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112609/ui-construction/templates). To this custom template add an UI element that will show the additional information (e.g. [<div>](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.ASP)). To pass data to this element, use a dedicated [ViewController](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.ViewController) that access the template and pass the required info to it.

Please note that this is quite a complex task, which requires good knowledge of XAF: [UI Customization Categories by Skill Level](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/application_framework/xaf-considerations-for-newcomers.xml#ui-customization-categories). You will likely need to research how our components work under the hood.

> Unfortunately, we can't help you much with such tasks as custom programming goes beyond our Support Service scope: [Technical Support Scope](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/application_framework/xaf-considerations-for-newcomers.xml#support).
